# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4 and created to demonstrate implementations of a few recently encountered techonlogies.

## Features

Following section titles can be used to search commit history for changes specific to each feature.

This project also includes extensive comments to help explain what each section of code does and how they relate to each of the below features.

### Change docs

[Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) used to enforce commit message structure and [conventional changeload standard version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) used to bump versions and auto generate a meaningful changelog.

These tools were installed locally ([commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#optional-install-and-run-commitizen-locally), [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)) and are executed via npm scripts.

This setup should make projects easier to approach for new team members.

This project also roughly follows [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) although not a highlighted feature of this project.

### App structure

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
